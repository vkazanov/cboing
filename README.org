A pure C and libSDL port of a game Boing! from the very cute [[https://github.com/Wireframe-Magazine/Code-the-Classics][Code the Classics]] book.
Boing! itself is a modernised [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong][Pong]].

* Motivation

  I wanted to play with SDL a bit but did not want to think about game design and assets
  issues. Code the Classics comes with a Github repo containing code in Python using the
  Pygame Zero, images, sounds and music I only had to port the logic itself.

* Compiling

  I developed the port using GCC 9.3.0 and the popular libSDL 2.x, SDL_Mixer, SDL_Image
  libraries on Ubuntu 20.04. Having all of the libraries installed the following should
  work:

  #+begin_src shell-script
    cd cboing
    make
    ./cboing/
  #+end_src

* Playing

  Pick a number of players.

  Controls for player 1: =up/down= or =a/z=.

  Controls for player 2: =m/k=.
